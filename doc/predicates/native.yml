  synopsis: |-
    User-defined tuple predicate
  description: |-
    So called 'native' predicates are functions computing truth values from
    tuples.
  notes: |-
    Native predicates can be any ruby Proc object of arity 1. The argument
    will be a Tuple instance. the Proc SHOULD return true or false, but ruby
    patterns for boolean expressions are supported to (such a nil evaluating
    to false, etc.).

    Note that, as of current Alf version, native predicates cannot be delegated
    to an underlying data engine, and are not compiled to SQL in particular.
    Please always use predicate factories such as `eq(:city, 'London')` if
    possible, as they do not hurt logical optimizations and compilation.
  signature: |-
    predicate: (Tuple -> Boolean)
  examples:

      ->(t){ t.city == 'London' }
