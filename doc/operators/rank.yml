  synopsis: |-
    Tuple ranking
  description: |-
    Extends tuples from the input relation with a new attribute (`as`)
    capturing the tuple position with respect to `order`.
    
    The ranking of a tuple `t` is more precisely defined as the number of
    tuples from the input operand that strictly come before `t` if they were
    all ordered according to `order`. 'Equal' tuples with respect to `order`
    are not counted in this ranking.
    
    This means that, unless `order` is a total order, duplicate ranking may
    be observed in practice. In contrast, if `order` covers a candidate key
    then the ranking attribute (`as`) is unique, and therefore defines an
    additional candidate key on the resulting relation.
  notes: |-
    Note that this operator does not compile to SQL so far. The `page` and
    `frame` operators provide useful alternatives when the aim is to compute
    a subset of tuples based on their ranking according to an order.
