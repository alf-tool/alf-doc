synopsis: |-
  Tuple ranking
description: |-
  Extends tuples from `operand` with a new attribute (`as`) capturing the
  tuple position with respect to `order`.
  
  The ranking of a tuple `t` is more precisely defined as the number of tuples
  from `operand` that would come strictly before `t` if they were all ordered
  according to `order`. 'Equal' tuples with respect to `order` are not counted
  in this ranking.
  
  This means that, unless `order` is a total order, duplicate ranking may be
  observed. In contrast, if `order` covers a candidate key then the ranking
  attribute (`as`) is unique, and therefore defines an additional candidate
  key for the resulting relation.
notes: |-
  Note that this operator does not compile to SQL so far. The `page` and
  `frame` operators provide useful alternatives when the aim is to compute
  a subset of tuples based on a ranking.
