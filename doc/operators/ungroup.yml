- name: ungroup
  synopsis: |-
    Inverse of group
  description: |-
    Computes the relation obtained by ungrouping a relation-valued attribute
    `rva`. Ungrouping `rva` leads as many tuples as in `rva`, each extended
    with the other attributes of `operand`.
    
    `rva` must be a relation-valued attribute. It should not itself contain
    any attribute whose name clashes with an attribute of `operand`.
  notes: |-
    This operator does not compile to SQL so far. Contributions are welcome
    to provide it with a SQL compilation for SQL DBMSs that support this kind
    of feature (e.g. PostgreSQL with JSON data type)
  signature: |-
