  synopsis: |-
    Tuple-valued attribute
  description: |-
    Computes the relation obtained by removing `attributes` and replacing them
    by a single attribute (`as`). The latter is a tuple-valued attribute
    obtained by projecting the input tuple on `attributes`.
    
    This operators supports an ALL BUT variant, through the `allbut` option.
    When set to true, the operator keeps specified attributes and wraps all
    the remaining ones as a tuple-valued attribute.
  notes: |-
    This operator does not compile to SQL so far. Contributions are welcome
    to provide it with a SQL compilation for SQL DBMSs that support this kind
    of feature (e.g. PostgreSQL with JSON data type)
