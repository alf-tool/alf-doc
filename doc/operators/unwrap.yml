name: unwrap
synopsis: |-
  Inverse of wrap
description: |-
  Computes the relation obtained by unwrapping a tuple-valued attribute `tva`.
  Unwrapping of `tva` on an input tuple `t` consists in removing `tva` from
  `t` and extending the result with `tva`'s own attributes:
  
  ```
  Tuple(x: 1, tva: Tuple(y: 2, z: 3)) -> Tuple(x: 1, y: 2, z: 3)
  ```
  
  `tva` must be a tuple-valued attribute. It should not itself contain any
  attribute whose name clashes with an attribute of `operand`. In the examples
  above, `tva` may not contain an attribute called `x`.
notes: |-
  This operator does not compile to SQL so far. Contributions are welcome to
  provide it with a SQL compilation for SQL DBMSs that support this kind of
  feature (e.g. PostgreSQL with JSON data type)
