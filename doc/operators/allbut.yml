- name: allbut
  synopsis: |-
    Projects a subset of attributes away.
  description: |-
    Computes the relation obtained by removing a subset of attributes from
    `operand` tuples.
    
    This operator is the inverse of `project`. While the latter _keeps_
    attributes, this one _removes_ them. `project` actually supports an allbut
    variant, which is equivalent to this operator. In other words, this
    operator can be seen as being the following shortcut:
    
    ```
    def allbut(operand, attributes)
      project(operand, attributes, allbut: true)
    end
    ```
  notes: |-
    Unlike SQL, this operator ALWAYS remove duplicates. There is no way, in
    Alf, to compute _bags_ of tuples.
