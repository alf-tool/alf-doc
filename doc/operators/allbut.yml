name: allbut
synopsis: |-
  Projects a subset of attributes away.
description: |-
  Computes the relation obtained by removing a subset of attributes from
  `operand` tuples.
  
  This operator is the inverse of `project`. While the latter _keeps_
  attributes, this one _removes_ them. `project` actually supports an allbut
  variant, which is equivalent to this operator. In other words, this
  operator can be understood as follows:
  
  ```try
  def allbut(operand, attributes)
    project(operand, attributes, allbut: true)
  end
  allbut(suppliers, [:city, :status])
  ```
notes: |-
  Unlike SQL, this operator ALWAYS remove duplicates. There is no way, in
  Alf, to compute _bags_ of tuples.
