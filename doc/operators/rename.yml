  Rename attributes
description: |-
  Computes the same relation as `operand` expect that some attributes have
  been renamed.
notes: |-
  As of current version, renamings can only be expressed through a Hash
  mapping input to output attribute names.
  
  Other ways of specifying renamining will be added in future versions, such
  as prefixing, postfixing, renaming through a Proc, etc. Any patch towards
  these improvements is welcome.
