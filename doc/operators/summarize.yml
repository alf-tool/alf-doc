name: summarize
synopsis: |-
  Aggregate and compute
description: |-
  Computes the relation obtained by taking the projection of `operand`
  on `by` attributes then extending each tuple `t` with the result of
  aggregations defined by `aggs` on the tuples from `operand` matching `t`.
  
  In SQL-ish terms, `SELECT [by], [agg] FROM operand GROUP BY [by]`.
notes: |-
  As of current Alf version, this operator cannot be translated to SQL code.
  That means that all computations are done in ruby, which may seriously
  hurt performance.
  
  Similarly, as `summarize` tends to be a showstopper during compilation, it
  is strongly recommanded to use it as high as possible in query expressions
  trees so as to delegate the largest possible query parts to data engines.
