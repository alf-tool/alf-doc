- name: restrict
  synopsis: |-
    Predicate-based filtering
  description: |-
    Computes a relation as a subset of `operand` tuples for which a tuple
    predicate evaluates to TRUE.
  notes: |-
    As of current Alf version, native predicates (through ruby `Proc` objects)
    cannot be optimized nor compiled to SQL. The use of high-level predicates
    (`eq`, `gt`, etc.) is strongly recommanded.

  examples:
    - |-
      restrict(suppliers, city: 'Paris', status: 20)
    - |-
      restrict(suppliers, eq(city: 'Paris') & gt(:status, 20))
    - |-
      restrict(suppliers, ->(t){ t.city == 'Paris' and t.status > 20 })
