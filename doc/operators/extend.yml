name: extend
synopsis: |-
  Extend input tuples with derived/computed attributes
description: |-
  Computes a relation which is the same as `operand`, except that each of
  its tuples has new attributes whose value is the result of evaluating the
  tuple expressions specified in `ext`.
notes: |-
  As of current Alf version, this operator cannot be translated to SQL code.
  That means that all computations are done in ruby, which may seriously
  hurt performance.
  
  Similarly, as `extend` tends to be a showstopper during compilation, it is
  strongly recommanded to use it as high as possible in query expressions
  trees so as to delegate the largest possible query parts to data engines.
